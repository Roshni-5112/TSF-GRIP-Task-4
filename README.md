# Sparks Foundation Internship - Task 4

## Project Overview
This project is part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation. The task involves building a decision tree classifier using the Iris dataset and visualizing it graphically. The purpose of the classifier is to predict the right class for new data inputs accurately.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, which is commonly used for classification tasks. It consists of measurements of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Decision Tree Classifier
The decision tree classifier is built using the scikit-learn library in Python. It is trained on the Iris dataset to learn the patterns and relationships between the input features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
